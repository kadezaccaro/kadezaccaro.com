            With years of working under Keller Williams, it became clear to the
            owners that they needed to distinguish themselves from other teams
            at KW. Their brand was unrecognizable beyond the parent brokerage.
            Many realtors face this as they rely on templates for their brand,
            which results in everyone blending in with the competition.

            With a new identity, they wanted their brand to target a luxury
            market while still being approachable to first-home buyers. We
            worked together to create a full branding package, having a
            collaborative review at each step of the process.

            BRAND NAMING
          </h3>
          <p style={{ color: "#121212" }}>
            Previously operating under their last name, I worked with the
            founders, George &amp; Page, to rename their company. The old name
            was difficult to remember, and they wanted a name to embrace them
            while they expand their team.
          </p>
          <p style={{ color: "#121212" }}>
            We were aiming for an ownable name that suggests both luxury and
            warmth to feel proud ofâ€”eventually landing on Grand Place. As an
            added charm, the owners love that their new business name happens to
            include their initials, G + P.

            LOGO, TYPE &amp; COLOR
          </h3>
          <p style={{ color: "#121212" }}>
            Starting with concept sketches, many ideas are then explored and
            refined into a few of the best options to present to the client.
          </p>
          <p style={{ color: "#121212" }}>
            I knew I wanted to explore an option that emphasizes the founders'
            initials within the business name. I solved this with a custom 'GP'
            mark, used as a piece to the full logo. The paired logotype is a
            customized treatment of the brand's main typeface, Playfair Display.
            Poppins is used for body copy and other supporting text.
          </p>
          <p style={{ color: "#121212" }}>
            Throughout the process, I enjoy considering different scenarios
            where the logo may used. Branding in this way creates more
            optimization, having a dedicated logo for each purpose.
